function [W_out] = affineMBTracker(img, tmp, rect, W_in, context)
% img is a geyscale image
% tmp is the template image
% rect is the bounding box
% W_in is the previous frame
% context is the precomputed J and H^-1 matrices
%
% W_out should be 3 by 3 that contains the new affine warp matrix updated so
% that it aligns the CURRENT frame with the TEMPLATE
