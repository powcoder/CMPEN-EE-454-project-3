function [affineMBContext] = initAffineMBTracker(img, rect)
% img is a greyscale image with a bouunding box rect
% affineMBContext is a Matlab structure that contains the Jacobian of the
% affine warp with respect to the 6 affine warp parameters and the inverse
% of the approximated Hessian matrix (J and H^-1)
